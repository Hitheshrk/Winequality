# Winequality
The quality of wine is a critical aspect of the wine industry, influencing consumer satisfaction and market competitiveness. Predicting wine quality accurately is challenging due to the complex interactions between various physicochemical properties. Machine Learning (ML) techniques provide valuable tools for analyzing large datasets and building predictive models. In this report, we explore the application of ML algorithms for predicting wine quality using the "winequality-red" dataset obtained from Kaggle.
